        <h3>Step 1: Prep Your Toppings and Tools</h3>
        <button type="button" class = "button-1">Step Done!</button>
        <img src = "https://food.fnr.sndimg.com/content/dam/images/food/fullset/2011/3/3/0/HT_0155037-OMELET-02_s4x3.jpg.rend.hgtvcom.616.462.suffix/1371595209516.jpeg">
		Have all your toppings ready before you start cooking the eggs — it comes together fast! Precook meats and vegetables such as mushrooms, onions and peppers, shred cheese and slice raw tomatoes, scallions and fresh herbs. Try two to three toppings to avoid overstuffing the omelet. Also, grab a serving plate and heatproof spatula.

		  <h3>Step 2: Add Water to Eggs</h3>
		  <button type="button" class = "button-2">Step Done!</button>

		Crack your eggs into a bowl and add a splash of water. When cooked, the steam from the water makes the omelet light and fluffy. 
		Whisk the egg mixture vigorously with a fork until the whites and yolks are completely blended.
	</div>
	<div id="tab-3" class="tab-info">
	<h3>Step 3: Heat Your Skillet</h3>
	<button type="button" class = "button-3">Step Done!</button>
	<img src = "https://food.fnr.sndimg.com/content/dam/images/food/fullset/2011/3/3/0/HT_0155037-OMELET-10_s4x3.jpg.rend.hgtvcom.616.462.suffix/1371595268177.jpeg">
		Heat a nonstick pan over medium-high heat. Add enough butter to coat the bottom of the pan. Use unsalted butter; that way, you can control the amount of salt in the omelet.
		The pan is ready when the foam from the butter subsides.
	</div>
	<div id="tab-4" class="tab-info">
		<h3>Step 4: Add the Egg Mixture</h3>
		<button type="button" class = "button-4">Step Done!</button>
		<img src = "https://food.fnr.sndimg.com/content/dam/images/food/fullset/2011/3/3/0/HT_0155037-OMELET-14_s4x3.jpg.rend.hgtvcom.616.462.suffix/1371595254402.jpeg">
		Pour the egg mixture into the hot pan, then let the eggs set a little along the edges — it will only take a few seconds.
	</div>
	<div id="tab-5" class="tab-info">
        <h3>Step 5: Gently "Scramble" the Egg Mixture</h3>
        <button type="button" class = "button-5">Step Done!</button>
        <img src = "https://food.fnr.sndimg.com/content/dam/images/food/fullset/2011/3/3/0/HT_0155037-OMELET-20_s4x3.jpg.rend.hgtvcom.616.462.suffix/1371595291656.jpeg">
		Using a spatula, pull the eggs in from all four sides toward the center, allowing the liquid egg to flow underneath the set part.
	</div>
	<div id="tab-6" class="tab-info">
		  <h3>Step 6: Add the Toppings</h3>
		  <button type="button" class = "button-7">Step Done!</button>
		  <img src = "https://food.fnr.sndimg.com/content/dam/images/food/fullset/2011/3/3/1/HT_0155037-OMELET-24_s4x3.jpg.rend.hgtvcom.616.462.suffix/1371595289699.jpeg">
		When the eggs are set on the outside but not quite in the center, it's time to add the toppings. Don't worry if it's a little soft; the eggs will continue cooking once the omelet is rolled.
	</div>
	<div id="tab-7" class="tab-info">
	<h3>Step 7: Fold the Omelet</h3>
	<button type="button" class = "button-8">Step Done!</button>
	<img src = "https://food.fnr.sndimg.com/content/dam/images/food/fullset/2011/3/3/1/HT_0155037-OMELET-27_s4x3.jpg.rend.hgtvcom.616.462.suffix/1371595285357.jpeg">
		Fold one-third of the omelet in with your spatula. The other side will fold over as you tilt it onto the plate.
	</div>
	<div id="tab-8" class="tab-info">
		<h3>Step 8: Flip the Omelet</h3>
		<button type="button">Step Done!</button>
		<img src = "https://food.fnr.sndimg.com/content/dam/images/food/fullset/2011/3/3/1/HT_0155037-OMELET-28_s4x3.jpg.rend.hgtvcom.616.462.suffix/1371595322331.jpeg">
		Tilt the skillet to fold the final third of the omelet over, then turn the skillet a little more so the omelet falls onto the plate folded-side down. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Congratulations — you've made the perfect omelet!
